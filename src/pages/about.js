      <p>
        About 6 months ago, I came to the realization that, in my current
        position as a golf professional, I was never going to be fully
        challenged. If I continued on this current track, I could certainly have
        a nice career, but I would never feel fulfilled. I realized I needed
        more from my career to grow as an individual, but I didn't know exactly
        what that would mean. I have an economics degree, so I thought I would
        pursue a position as a data analyst. Typically, the requirements for
        this type of job were some sort of business degree coupled with some
        sort of database coding knowledge, such as SQL. I took a course on mySQL
        and realized that, not only was coding something I was capable of, but I
        loved it.

        I started doing some research to find my next move after this class, and
        kept seeing posts about learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, so I figured
        I'd give it a try. Within a couple of hours, I created a simple HTML
        site and launched to a local server; immediately I was captivated. I
        wanted to know everything there was to know about this crazy world. I
        consumed course after course through various platforms, starting out
        with several courses from Udemy and then moving on to a more focused
        approach on Frontend Masters. Every night, I would get off work and race
        home to start studying and learning. It has become an obsession, and
        I've loved every minute of it.

        After 6 months, I've accomplished a lot and my passion for this complex
        world has grown by the day. I've taken over 300 hours of coursework and
        deployed around 30 projects to Github. My focus has primarily been in
        JavaScript and React, but I've also studied quite a bit about Node, CSS,
        and VueJS. These newfound technical skills, coupled with around 15 years
        in the customer service industry and the soft skills attained there,
        give me a unique profile of attributes that would prove very useful. I
        have shown that I don't require any outside motivation for learning new
        things and I take great pleasure in the act. If hired, my value as an
        employee would be limitless.
